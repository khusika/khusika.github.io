Hi, I’m Khusika, an amateur developer from Indonesia. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in [Agro-Industrial Technology](https://tip.ub.ac.id/en/) from [Brawijaya University](https://www.ub.ac.id/en/) and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in [Human Resource and Development](https://pasca.unair.ac.id/s2-pengembangan-sumber-daya-manusia/) at [Airlangga University](https://unair.ac.id/). My interests center on the creative industries, with a particular focus on integrating IoT solutions and advancing sustainable tourism development.

### Publications

The items below highlight selected publications and scientific journal written by me.

* [Cakrawarta](https://www.cakrawarta.com/): [_From the Outskirts, Creative Tourism Villages Embroider Sustainable Economies_](https://www.cakrawarta.com/dari-pinggiran-desa-wisata-kreatif-menyulam-ekonomi-berkelanjutan.html)

### Projects & Contributions

Below here are some of projects and contributions done by me:

* [Canting Kernel](/canting): is an android-kernel based on Google kernel-common merged over CAF-kernel. Built to provide security and stability improvement.

* [Hugo FeelIt](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt): is a clean, elegant but advanced blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). FeelIt is based on and inspired by the original [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and [KeepIt](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt) themes.

* [RAJApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pit.qrcodesrajabrawijaya): The application was developed under the [Rajabrawijaya 2017 committee](https://rajabrawijaya.ub.ac.id/), with the primary objective of providing an attendance system utilizing a QR code scanner. During this period, I contributed as a front-end developer in the creation of this application. The app was removed from the Play Store due to inactivity and later delisted because of new Play Store developer policy requirements that were not implemented.

* [XDA-Developers](https://xdaforums.com/m/khusika.5123347/): I earned the titles of [_Recognized Developer_](https://xdaforums.com/t/recognized-developer-code-of-conduct-minimum-requirements.4510165/) and [_Recognized Contributor_](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-apply-to-become-a-recognized-contributor-themer-on-xda.1646309/#post-25915966) within the XDA Forums. During my time there I created various open-source projects, including ROMs, kernels, and mods. In early 2024 I joined the forum as a [_Forum Moderator_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lK5rP103OL3StU3q9iqwX9LU_k8XABeSQIAT3EHCqgM/pub) and remained active until my retirement from the ~~forum~~ moderation in 2025.

* [Pixys OS](https://pixysos.com/): I served as a device [maintainer](https://pixysos.com/team/khusika) for the Poco X3 Pro, as highlighted in [this change](https://github.com/PixysOS/official_devices/pull/109). Additionally, I actively contributed to Pixys OS through [my gerrit changes](https://gerrit.pixysos.com/q/owner:mail%2540khusika.dev). This project is discontinued for me — I am no longer an active developer or maintainer and have stepped away from the Pixys OS community.

* I have submitted various kernel fixes to [lineageos.org](https://lineageos.org/) through [my code-review](https://review.lineageos.org/q/owner:mail@khusika.dev) contributions. Some of the most significant patches I have provided include the integration of `vDSO32` and kernel compilation fixes with `CC_WERROR` for Xiaomi devices. These contributions aim to enhance the functionality and stability of the platform.
