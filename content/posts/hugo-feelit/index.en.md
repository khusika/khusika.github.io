Introducing **FeelIt**, a **clean**, **elegant**, and **feature-rich theme** for Hugo that I created, and the release of `v1.0.3` with many UI/UX improvements.

<!--more-->


## Introduction

For those building a website with Hugo, choosing the right theme is a crucial first step. A good theme not only defines the look and feel of your site but also provides the features you need to create and manage your content effectively.

With that in mind, I'd like to talk about **FeelIt**, a theme I've been passionately developing. FeelIt is a fork of the popular and well-loved [**LoveIt**](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), originally created by [Dillon](https://github.com/dillonzq). While building upon the great foundation of LoveIt, I have taken FeelIt in a new direction, focusing on extensive UI/UX enhancements, new features, and ongoing maintenance.

My goal is to make FeelIt a clean, elegant, and powerful theme for the Hugo community. You can read more about it on the official documentation site: [https://feelit.khusika.id/](https://feelit.khusika.id/).

## Announcing FeelIt v1.0.3

To kick things off, I'm excited to release **v1.0.3**!

This version is a significant update that focuses on enhancing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). I've gone through the theme to fix bugs, refactor code, and introduce some new features.

Some of the key highlights of this release include:

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Pinned Posts**: You can now pin important posts to the top of your homepage.
*   **Giscus Comments**: Added support for [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), a modern commenting system powered by GitHub Discussions.
*   **PWA Enhancements**: Improved Progressive Web App support with better caching for a faster offline experience.
*   **Related Content**: Posts now feature a "Related Content" section in the footer to improve navigation.
*   **UI Improvements**:
    *   Author avatars are now displayed in post metadata.
    *   The layout for tags has been redesigned into a "box" style.
    *   The profile/about page has an improved layout and styling.

### üêõ Fixes & Improvements

*   **Hugo Compatibility**: Addressed several breaking changes from recent Hugo versions to ensure the theme works flawlessly.
*   **Styling Fixes**: Corrected various styling inconsistencies, including post-author size and dark mode improvements.
*   **oEmbed**: Updated Twitter (X) oEmbed usage to reflect recent platform changes.
*   **Dependencies**: Updated core dependencies like `TypeIt.js` and `modern-normalize.css` for better performance and security.
