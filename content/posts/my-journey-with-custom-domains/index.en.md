I want to share a story about using a custom domain on the blog that I published. Before getting to the main topic, it's worth mentioning that this blog was initially deployed via GitHub Pages. I chose Hugo as the framework for this static website because its documentation is easily accessible and user-friendly.

## The Beginning
I first published this blog with a custom `.com` domain on August 19, 2019, registered with nusa.id. This was my first experience registering and creating a paid custom domain. I am a little unfamiliar with Registrars and Domains, so why did I choose the registrar nusa.id? At first I bought a domain and was interested in professional email services using Google Workspace with the `mail[at]khusika.com` address. I continued using nusa.id's services for two years until my subscription ended on August 19, 2021.

## Transition to idcloudhost.com
Exactly one day after my subscription expired, I transitioned to idcloudhost.com on August 19, 2021. The move was prompted by nusa.id's lack of _DNS Management_ services in their ClientArea and the absence of free _WHOIS Privacy Protection_. However, I retained my Google Workspace subscription with nusa.id due to it's cost advantage over idcloudhost.com.

## Exploring New Domains
Over time, I grew weary of the .com domain as it did not align with my branding focused on Android development. Consequently, I sought a new registrar to purchase a `.dev` domain that better reflected my interests. With some savings in my PayPal account, I chose namecheap.com to buy the `khusika.dev`. My initial transaction was on July 17, 2022, followed by a renewal on February 6, 2023, extending the domain's use until July 17, 2024. I continued using Google Workspace from nusa.id, changing my email to `mail[at]khusika.dev`. This was my first experience with an international domain provider, and I found their services more responsive compared to my previous registrars.

## Financial Challenges and Domain Grace Period
At the end of the grace period, I faced financial constraints which led to my blog entering a domain grace period and becoming inactive for a month. I missed the opportunity to transfer the domain at a reasonable price and encountered difficulties finding a local registrar that accepted Indonesian Rupiah.

## Final Decision to Move to .id Domain
A month later, on September 18, 2024, I registered a new domain, `khusika.id`, with qwords.com. I felt this domain better represented my love for my homeland. The price was comparable to the `.dev` domain. I also decided to discontinue my Google Workspace subscription due to rising costs and diminishing benefits. I hope to continue using this domain long-term and have no plans to switch registrars.

This journey reflects the dynamic nature of managing a blog's domain and the decisions influenced by both practical and sentimental considerations.

## Conclusion
I hope my story provides a useful perspective for others embarking on similar journeys. Whether you're a developer, a blogger, or anyone interested in domain management, the key takeaway is to remain flexible and open to change while keeping your goals and values at the forefront. Always be prepared for unexpected challenges and use them as opportunities to learn and grow.
